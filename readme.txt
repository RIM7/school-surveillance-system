What our model does:

	1. Cropped or zoomed in faces might cause blurring. So our model won't predict such photos.
	2. If there are multiple faces in an image, our model doesn't process it.

Unfinished stuffs:
	1. Front End.
	2. Store the model in .h5 format.

Future scope:
	1. Use Siamese net and one shot learning for better times.
	2. Stop training on all people when someone new is added.
